- Crosswalks between different metadata schemas
- Metadata enrichment through automated processes

### Digital Preservation
- Digital preservation planning and strategy development
- Format assessment and risk analysis
- Preservation action planning and implementation
- Long-term access and sustainability planning
- Digital asset management best practices

### Cultural Artifact Analysis
- Digital imaging and visualization of cultural artifacts
- 3D modeling and virtual reconstruction
- Material analysis through digital techniques
- Provenance tracking and authentication
- Cultural context analysis and interpretation

### Heritage Documentation
- Digital storytelling for cultural heritage
- Interactive documentation of heritage sites
- Community-based heritage documentation
- Multimodal documentation techniques
- Digital exhibition curation

### Heritage Data Integration
- Integration of heterogeneous heritage datasets
- Linked open data for cultural heritage
- Semantic web technologies for heritage information
- Cross-institutional data sharing and collaboration
- Heritage data visualization and exploration
