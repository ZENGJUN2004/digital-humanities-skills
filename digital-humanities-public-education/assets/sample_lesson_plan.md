### 3. Tools and Techniques (20 minutes)
- **Activity 1**: Demonstration - Showcase basic digital storytelling tools
- **Activity 2**: Hands-on - Brief exploration of one tool (e.g., StoryMapJS)
- **Activity 3**: Discussion - Advantages and limitations of different tools

### 4. Creating a Digital Story (25 minutes)
- **Activity 1**: Planning - Students develop a simple digital story concept
- **Activity 2**: Creation - Students create a short digital story using a chosen tool
- **Activity 3**: Peer Feedback - Students share their work and receive feedback

- **Activity 2**: Reflection - How can digital storytelling be used in different humanities disciplines?
- **Activity 3**: Assessment - Students complete a short reflection on their learning

## Assessment
- **Formative Assessment**: Peer feedback during the creation activity
- **Summative Assessment**: Digital story project with reflection (due next class)
- **Rubric**: Storytelling effectiveness (40%), Technical execution (30%), Reflection quality (30%)

## Differentiation
